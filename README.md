# Genesis-Grades-Notifications
A program that automatically sends a notification to your phone when a grade is updated in Genesis. The notification is sent to your phone using an email client, and Genesis is checked periodically to see if anything has been posted or changed. Sensitive and personal information has been redacted with with asterisk marks, so if you are using the program, you might need to put in your own information there. Note: the Assignments.json file will be empty when you first download it, but it will contain all assignments after the program is run once (make sure it is in the same directory as Genesis.py).
